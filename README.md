## Run the application in dev mod

`npm i && npm run startDev`

## Build production build

`npm build`

## Serve production build locally

`npm start`

## Notes

I would normally just build a static app for this kind of app, but I had to build the server because of cors to your api.

I wouldn't normally include the built artifact in git, but I don't trust free tier heroku with any more build steps than necessary
